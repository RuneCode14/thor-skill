description: Run THOR scans and propose the exact command line for Windows, Linux, or macOS. Use when the user wants to scan a host, a directory, a mounted image, or a memory dump with THOR v10/v11.

# THOR Scan Skill

Goal: produce a safe, reproducible THOR command line and minimal preflight checks.

Rules

- Prefer THOR v10 stable unless the user explicitly wants v11 TechPreview features.
- Always start with environment detection: OS, THOR path, license presence, and whether thor-util exists.
- Identify if user has full THOR or THOR Lite (different binaries, different capabilities).
- Avoid "magic flags". Explain why each non-trivial flag is used.
- Default to focusing on forensic / lab workflows; if it's live endpoint scanning, keep it conservative.

Preflight checklist

1. Get the THOR install path (or infer from current working dir).
2. Verify binaries exist:
   - Full THOR: `thor64.exe` (Windows), `thor-linux-64` (Linux), `thor-macosx` (macOS)
   - THOR Lite: `thor64-lite.exe` (Windows), `thor-lite-linux-64` (Linux), `thor-lite-macos` (macOS)
3. Check license files (*.lic) in THOR dir.
4. Check thor-util presence for update/diagnostics/report tasks.
5. Identify scan target type:
   - live path, mounted image, memory dump, extracted dumps, SSHFS-mounted remote
6. Choose scan mode and output location; keep outputs deterministic.
7. If THOR Lite: note that lab mode and Sigma are unavailable. See [THOR Lite limitations](../thor-lite/SKILL.md).

Output format
- First line: one recommended command (single-line).
- Then: short explanation of key flags.
- Then: "If it fails" section with 2-3 likely causes and next commands to run.
